        Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are <a href="nowhere">marine molluscs</a> of the order Sepiida. They belong to the
        class Cephalopoda, which
        also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
        is used for control of buoyancy. <br>

        Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
        which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
        species, Sepia apama, reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3]<br>

        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators
        include dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a
        cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent
        invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]<br>

        The "cuttle" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the species, cudele, which may be cognate with
        the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5] The Greco-Roman world valued the
        cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed. The
        word for it in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English.<br>
