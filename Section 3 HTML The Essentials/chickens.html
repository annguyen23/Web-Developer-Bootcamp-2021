            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">junglefowl</a>, is a type of domesticated
            fowl, originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male
            may be
            called a cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen.
            "Chicken"
            was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant
            menus
            has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. In older
            sources common fowl or domestic fowl were typically used for this.

            Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
            Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BCE).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
            (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>
                An adult male is a called a cock or rooster (in the United States) and an adult female is called a
                hen.[10][11]

        <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
        <p>Chickens are omnivores.[25] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and
            even
            animals as large as lizards, small snakes,
            <sup>[26]</sup>
            <!--supscript, smaller upper text-->
            or young mice.[27]

        The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.[28] The world's oldest known
        chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness World
        Records.[29]

        Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny,
        pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder
        colours
        than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster
        has
        only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking
        at
        the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain
        hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on
        their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called
        wattles.
        Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the
        adult
        male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A muff or
        beard is
        a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving
        the
        appearance of a beard. Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens
        are
        generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would
        naturally
        roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to
        flee
        perceived danger.
